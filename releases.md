## Versioning Scheme

AvaIre follows the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) scheme, following the convention: `major.minor.patch`. Minor application releases represents new addtions, commands, features and reworks of the existing codebase. Patch releases represents bug fixes, refractoring of existing code and very minor changes that wont affect other things in the code base

Major releases are separated by many months or years and represent fundamental shifts in the applications's architecture and conventions.
