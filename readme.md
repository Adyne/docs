# Contribution Guidelines

If you are submitting documentation for the **current stable release**, submit it to the corresponding branch. For example, documentation for AvaIre 1.1 would be submitted to the `1.1` branch. Documentation intended for the next release of AvaIre should be submitted to the `master` branch.
